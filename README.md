# GCP vscode server

run vscode server on GCP

> Idea taken from [https://github.com/aws-samples/cloud9-to-power-vscode-blog](https://github.com/aws-samples/cloud9-to-power-vscode-blog)


## Summary

This repo provides samples to connect GCP instance via
* [Identity-Aware Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/iap)
* Start instance when ssh connected
* Automatic stop after deactivation

Currently, I uses `powershell` to start my linux server. Feel free to add new features, like `bash` script, specifiy zone, and etc.

## Pros and cons
* Save money (The server only runs when you are online)
* Takes time to cold start the server

## Steps:

1. Create an instance as your dev server
    * you can also use pre-existed isntance.
    * Please include extrnal ip, or public internet access. Even though [Identity-Aware Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/iap) should work if this server does not have an extrnal ip, we still need to download vscode server from internet.

1. Install `gcloud` on your client server
    * https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install

1. Run `gcloud init`
    * Input your account and region.

1. Run `gcloud compute config-ssh`

    This will create files under `~/.ssh`

    ```
    │  config
    │  google_compute_engine
    │  google_compute_engine.ppk
    │  google_compute_engine.pub
    ```

    Meanwhile, in the `config` file.
    ```
    # Google Compute Engine Section
    #
    # The following has been auto-generated by "gcloud compute config-ssh"
    # to make accessing your Google Compute Engine virtual machines easier.
    #
    # To remove this blob, run:
    #
    #   gcloud compute config-ssh --remove
    #
    # You can also manually remove this blob by deleting everything from
    # here until the comment that contains the string "End of Google Compute
    # Engine Section".
    #
    # You should not hand-edit this section, unless you are deleting it.
    #
    Host YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME.us-central1-a.YOUR_PROJECT
        HostName YOUR_INSTANCE_IP
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine
        UserKnownHostsFile=~/.ssh/google_compute_known_hosts
        HostKeyAlias=compute.YOUR_INSTANCE_ID
        IdentitiesOnly=yes
        CheckHostIP=no

    # End of Google Compute Engine Section
    ```
    You may omit this, since we just need the project level private key in `google_compute_engine`.


1. Now put something like this in your `~/.ssh/config`
```
Host vscode-dev-server
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine
    User YOUR_USERNAME
    HostName YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME
    ProxyCommand powershell -Command "~/.ssh/gcloud/start-dev-server.ps1" %h
```
`vscode-dev-server` is your Host alias.

1. Copy the contents of `ssh/gcloud/start-dev-server.ps1` to `~/.ssh/gcloud/start-dev-server.ps1`
    * When the server is started initially, i.e. from `TERMINATED` to `RUNNING`, the `RUNNING` status may not indicate that the server is ready to handle ssh connections. You may receive `Error Code 4047. Either the instance doesn't exist, or the instance is stopped.` My solution is to sleep 30 seconds before ssh connection. (I do not have a workaround to this.)

1. Copy `spot-if-inactive.sh` to your server, and edit if necessary.
    * When your close your vscode remote ssh session, the `server.sh` in server may still run for 3-5 minutes, and the `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=5` is triggered when no process is running 

1. Run `crontab -e` and put
    `* * * * * YOUR_PATH_TO/stop-if-inactive.sh`

1. Now, enjoy with vscode remote ssh.

### Extra nots
If you wanna to test ssh connection, use `ssh vscode-dev-server -vvv` to debug.
